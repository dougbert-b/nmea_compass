ESP32-based electronic compass, based on a "ESP32 DEVKIT V1" board and an Adafruit BNO055 sensor board.
Outputs both NMEA1083 heading and NMEA2000 heading and attitude.

Data can be read, and various settings can be configured via BLE.
I use a simple BLE scanner app on my Android phone to access that data.
